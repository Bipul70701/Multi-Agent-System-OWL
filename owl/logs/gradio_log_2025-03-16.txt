 Instruction: Use the gathered statistics to write a Python script that uses a plotting package to visualize the data. 
Input: None
2025-03-16 02:01:10,366 - camel.owl.utils.enhanced_role_playing - INFO - Round #2 assistant_response:
 Solution: Since I couldn't directly access the statistics from the GitHub repository, I'll provide you with a template Python script that you can use to visualize the data once you have it. You can fill in the actual numbers for stars, forks, etc., and the script will generate a bar chart using the `matplotlib` package.

Here's a sample Python script:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Replace these values with the actual statistics from the GitHub repository
stars = 100  # Example value
forks = 50   # Example value
watchers = 30  # Example value
issues = 10   # Example value

# Data for plotting
labels = ['Stars', 'Forks', 'Watchers', 'Issues']
values = [stars, forks, watchers, issues]

# Create a bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(labels, values, color=['blue', 'green', 'red', 'purple'])

# Add title and labels
plt.title('GitHub Repository Statistics for camel-ai/camel')
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Count')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

To use this script:
1. Install `matplotlib` if you haven't already by running `pip install matplotlib`.
2. Replace the example values with the actual statistics you gather from the GitHub repository.
3. Run the script to visualize the data.

If you have the actual numbers and need further assistance with the script, feel free to provide them!
